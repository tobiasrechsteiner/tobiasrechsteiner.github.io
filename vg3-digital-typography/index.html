            <p>GT Sectra is a contemporary serif typeface combining the calligraphy of the broad nib pen with the sharpness of the
               scalpel knive. It was originally designed for use in the long-form journalism magazine “Reportagen” and now expanded
               to its three subfamilies: GT Sectra, GT Sectra Fine, and GT Sectra Display.</p>
