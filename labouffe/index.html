            We’d like to feast with you! Franziska Veh (Studio Veh) and Tobias Rechsteiner (Grilli Type) would like to
            invite you for a dinner at the studio. The creative scene of Berlin is vast and we had the idea to bring a
            few individuals to the same table to get to know each other and mingle for an evening. The evening will take
            place at our studio at Glasowerstrasse 44 in Berlin Neukölln. We’ll order a nice dinner and take care of the
            atmosphere. You’ll bring yourself and a drink of your choice. If you RSVP with Yes, we’ll send you all the
            necessary information and would like to ask you to contribute towards the cost of the dinner. We’re looking
            forward to getting to know you!
